# Text-Mining-Tweepy
I have compared the popularity of three programming languages - Python, JavaScript and Ruby among Twitter users.  

In **tweepy.py** file, I have used Tweepy - a Python library for accessing Twitter API and to extract the tweets relevant the above three programming languages.

All the tweets have been saved in **twitter_data.txt**.

With the help of pandas and matplotlib, I have compared the popularity of Python, JavaScript and Ruby in **tweet_analysis.py**.
